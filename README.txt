MIXED MESSAGING PROJECT

OBJECTIVES

The objective of the project is to develop a code that displays random messages every time the code is called and what I simply 
did was to create a Math.random and Math.floor variable for the code and added the different messages showing the status 
of a car that has possible faults to be repaired, stating if the fault is resolved or still pending.

The code is not all that complex though, showing my current level of coding but of course, there is room for further improvements and 
I hope to return to the project and improve upon it in the nearest future as I need to continue improving on my coding 
skills.

Happy review of my codes.

Cheers.
